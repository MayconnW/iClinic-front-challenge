# iClinic-front-challenge

### The challenge
This project was written to resolve the iClinic challenge (https://github.com/iclinic/challenge-front).

### About
I can say that it was a pleasure to develop this test. And I'm happy with the final result. I did the project using React with TypeScript. I also applied the linter tool (es-lint) in my code. In my opinion, to resolve this test, you need to know the React universe and the javascript universe too, cause there is a trick here, that you need to get the fastest API call. And of course, you need to be in the React universe to see the layout and be able to copy that with HTML and CSS.

### Just a Point
There is a point that I have noticed in this test, the majority times "Darth Vader" will win, not because he is stronger (haha), but the response from the "Darth Vader" API is 100 bytes smaller than "Luke"s one.

### Running
You can check the demo here (https://iclinic-challenge.herokuapp.com/)

To run the Project (wow), there is no secret, follow these instructions.
1 - Git clone
2 - In the project root, there is a file called ".env.example", copy this file as ".env" in the root. Inside there is a variable that refers to the "Star Wars" API. This file exists in case the API URL needs to change from dev and prod environments.
3 - run "yarn start" and have fun!

### Tests
This part is really important, and I have written the tests for the pages and components. To execute the tests, you can run "yarn test". There is an option to see the coverage too, run "yarn test:coverage", this will create a folder called "coverage/Icov-report" in the root, inside just look for the index.html and open it.

## To Finish
I can say again that it was a pleasure to make this test. I hope to get a feedback, this will help me improve my skills. It's important to hear people's opinion about our work.
